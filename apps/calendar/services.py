    Before the ``assign_queue_slots`` guard landed, re-running a queue (adding or
    reordering a post) re-slotted *every* entry — including already-published
    ones — pushing their ``scheduled_at`` onto a future posting slot. Because the
    calendar places chips by ``scheduled_at``, those posts then showed as
    "published" up to a week ahead.

    A correctly-published post always has ``scheduled_at <= published_at`` (you
    schedule, then it fires at or after that instant). ``scheduled_at >
    published_at`` is therefore an unambiguous signature of this corruption, so
    the repair targets exactly those rows and resets ``scheduled_at`` to the true
    ``published_at``. Idempotent and safe to re-run: once reset, a row no longer
    matches the filter.

    The same bad future slot was also written to the matching
    ``QueueEntry.assigned_slot_datetime`` (the queue the bug walked, where
    ``queue.social_account == platform_post.social_account``). ``queue_detail``
    renders that field and the published-status guard stops ``assign_queue_slots``
    from ever recomputing a published entry, so the repair snaps that stale queue
    timestamp back to ``published_at`` too (same ``> published_at`` signature).

    Returns a summary dict ``{"rows": [...], "platform_post_count": int,
